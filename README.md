# Getting started

This repository is intended to help NEWtrinos get up and running with github 
and code. 

## Software

Code for Team Neutrino is organized in github repositories under the 
[Team Neutrino organization](https://github.com/team-neutrino). 

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version-control software that keeps track of 
every code change, who made the change, when the change was made, etc. 
This allows the code to be rolled back at any moment. 
In order to use git on your computer, you will need to 
[download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install git.

While you can interact with git using a command prompt or terminal on your
computer, many Neutrinos prefer a graphical user interface (GUI). 
The most common GUI used by the team is 
[Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop).
To use Github Desktop, you will need to 
[download](https://desktop.github.com/download/) and install Github Desktop.

Git is organized into repositories and these repositories will be hosted in a
central location. Team Neutrino uses a 
[GitHub Organization](https://github.com/team-neutrino)
to host these repositories. 
For team members to interact with the Team Neutrino repositories,
they need to be a member of the Team Neutrino GitHub Organization. 
To be added, 

1. Create a [github.com](https://github.com/) account
1. Post the following in the #general slack channel:

    @Moriah Zimmerman please add my to the Team Neutrino GitHub Organization. My user name is <username>
    
where you replace `<username>` with your github.com username. 



### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

While code can technically be written in any plain-text editor, 
it is typically helpful to use an integrated development environment (IDE).
The most commonly used IDE on the team is 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
To use Visual Studio Code, you need to 
[download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install VS Code.
