## Robot Basics 

### WPILib Installer
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) to install WPILib. This will install a new instance of VSCode along with the required extensions to program a robot.

### Driver Station
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html#installing-the-frc-game-tools) to install the NI FRC Game Tools. This can install a number of NI tools, but on Team Neutrino we only use the Driver Station.
